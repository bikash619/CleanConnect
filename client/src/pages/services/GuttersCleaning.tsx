          question: "How often should gutters be cleaned?",
          answer: "Most homes benefit from gutter cleaning twice a year â€“ typically in spring and fall. However, homes surrounded by trees may require more frequent cleaning, especially after storms or heavy leaf fall."

          question: "What happens if I don't clean my gutters?",
          answer: "Neglected gutters can lead to water overflow, which can damage your roof, fascia boards, walls, and foundation. Standing water in gutters can also attract pests and lead to mold growth."
