          question: "How often should I have my windows professionally cleaned?",
          answer: "For residential properties, we recommend professional window cleaning twice a year. However, homes in areas with high pollution, near construction sites, or close to the ocean may benefit from quarterly cleaning."
        },
        {
          question: "Can you clean windows in rainy weather?",
          answer: "While light rain doesn't necessarily prevent window cleaning, heavy rain or storms will require rescheduling. Our cleaning solutions are designed to repel water, so a light rain after cleaning won't immediately ruin the results."
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need to do anything to prepare for window cleaning?",
          answer: "We recommend removing personal items from windowsills and ensuring clear access to each window by moving furniture or obstacles. This helps our team work efficiently and protects your belongings."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you clean screens and tracks as well?",
          answer: "Yes, our comprehensive window cleaning service includes cleaning the glass, frames, tracks, and screens to ensure your entire window system is spotless."
